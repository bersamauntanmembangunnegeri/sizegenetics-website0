Its development stems from established traction principles used in orthopedics, where sustained mechanical tension encourages tissue adaptation. Understanding its design and mechanism is crucial for responsible usage.</p>\n\n  <h3>What is SizeGenetics?</h3>\n  <p>SizeGenetics is a prescription-grade or over-the-counter medical device (availability varies by region) employing traction therapy. It consists of a base ring worn around the penis shaft or base, connected to adjustable traction rods extending along the shaft, culminating in a headpiece securing the glans. Tension is applied gradually by extending the rods. While sometimes marketed for male enhancement, its primary medically recognized application, supported by clinical studies, is the treatment of Peyronie's disease—a condition causing penile curvature due to scar tissue (plaque). Research also explores its potential, though less definitively established, in addressing perceived length deficiencies post-prostatectomy or congenital anomalies.</p>\n\n  <h3>How Does Traction Therapy Work?</h3>\n  <p>The scientific premise of traction therapy involves the principle of tissue remodeling under sustained, low-tension force. Applying consistent traction to penile tissues (tunica albuginea, collagen fibers) is believed to stimulate cellular processes:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>Cellular Stretch Response:</strong> Mechanical tension triggers fibroblasts (cells responsible for collagen production) to break down and reorganize collagen structures, increasing tissue elasticity and length over time.</li>\n    <li><strong>Angiogenesis:</strong> Some studies suggest traction may promote the formation of new blood vessels, potentially improving tissue health.</li>\n    <li><strong>Peyronie's Application:</strong> In Peyronie's disease, traction aims to counteract the contractile forces of plaques, potentially reducing curvature and preventing worsening deformity, often used alongside other treatments like CCH injections.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>Evidence for penile lengthening in individuals without Peyronie's is less robust and primarily based on limited clinical observations and patient self-reports, not large-scale randomized controlled trials.</p>\n\n  <h2>Safety Precautions and Medical Consultation</h2>\n  <p>Prioritizing safety is paramount when considering any medical device. Penile traction therapy is not suitable for everyone.</p>\n\n  <h3>The Importance of Professional Guidance</h3>\n  <p><strong>Consultation with a qualified urologist or healthcare provider is mandatory</strong> before initiating use of SizeGenetics or any traction device. They can:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Diagnose any underlying conditions (e.g., Peyronie's, erectile dysfunction, infections, vascular issues) that might contraindicate traction therapy.</li>\n    <li>Assess suitability based on your individual anatomy and health history.</li>\n    <li>Provide personalized advice on usage protocols.</li>\n    <li>Monitor progress and identify potential complications early.</li>\n    <li>Offer realistic expectations based on your specific situation and the available scientific evidence.</li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <h3>Contraindications: When Not to Use</h3>\n  <p>SizeGenetics should <strong>not</strong> be used in the following situations without explicit medical clearance:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Active infections (penile, urinary tract, skin).</li>\n    <li>Uncontrolled bleeding disorders or anticoagulant therapy.</li>\n    <li>Severe erectile dysfunction preventing adequate flaccid manipulation.</li>\n    <li>Priapism (prolonged erection) history.</li>\n    <li>Penile implants, severe Peyronie's with calcified plaques, or recent penile surgery/trauma.</li>\n    <li>Sensory disorders affecting the genital area (e.g., neuropathy).</li>\n    <li>Known hypersensitivity to device materials (silicone, plastic).</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><strong>Discontinue use immediately</strong> and seek medical attention if you experience severe pain, numbness lasting beyond removal, bruising, blisters, open sores, changes in erection quality, or discoloration.</p>\n\n  <h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Using SizeGenetics</h2>\n  <p>Adherence to the manufacturer's instructions and medical advice is critical. This guide outlines general principles, but specifics may vary.</p>\n\n  <h3>Initial Setup and Fitting</h3>\n  <p>Begin conservatively:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>Clean & Dry:</strong> Ensure penis and device components are clean and completely dry.</li>\n    <li><strong>Protective Sleeve/Wrap:</strong> Apply the provided foam comfort pad or medical-grade silicone sleeve securely around the glans and shaft to prevent slippage and distribute pressure. Never apply traction directly to bare skin.</li>\n    <li><strong>Base Ring:</strong> Place the base ring comfortably at the penile base. It should be snug but not constricting blood flow (check for immediate coldness or numbness).</li>\n    <li><strong>Attachment:</strong> Attach the traction rods/bars to the base ring and the headpiece.</li>\n    <li><strong>Initial Tension:</strong> Set rods to the shortest or minimal extension setting initially. The sensation should be gentle stretching, <strong>never pain</strong>.</li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <h3>Wearing the Device: Duration and Adjustment</h3>\n  <p>The \"no pain\" principle governs progression:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>Gradual Acclimatization:</strong> Start with short sessions (30-60 minutes), 1-2 times per day.</li>\n    <li><strong>Progressive Increase",
