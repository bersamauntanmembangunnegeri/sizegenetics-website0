Among these, SizeGenetics exemplifies traction-based extenders, alongside vacuum pumps and other modalities. This article examines the scientific principles, safety profiles, and evidence behind these methods, emphasizing critical distinctions to inform evidence-based decision-making.</p>\n    </section>\n\n    ## Core Categories of Enhancement Devices\n    Male enhancement devices primarily fall into two distinct categories based on their mechanisms:\n\n    ### Traction Devices (e.g., SizeGenetics)\n    These devices apply constant, low-tension mechanical force to the penis shaft over extended periods (typically several hours daily for months). The proposed mechanism, derived from orthopedic tissue expansion principles, involves inducing controlled micro-trauma in penile tissues. This theoretically stimulates cellular division (mitosis) and collagen synthesis, potentially leading to tissue remodeling. Devices like SizeGenetics consist of a base ring, adjustable rods, and a strap/attachment system.\n\n    ### Vacuum Pumps\n    These devices use manual or battery-powered suction to create negative pressure around the penis, drawing blood into the corpora cavernosa to induce an erection-like state. Short-term use is sometimes medically prescribed for erectile dysfunction (ED). Some proponents claim regular use can increase size permanently via tissue stretching, though evidence for sustained structural change is significantly weaker than for traction.\n\n    ## Scientific Basis and Proposed Mechanisms\n    Understanding the differing physiological claims is crucial:\n\n    ### Traction Devices: Cellular Adaptation Theory\n    Research into tissue expansion stems from reconstructive surgery, where sustained tension gradually grows skin and soft tissue. Applied to the penis, peer-reviewed studies (primarily focused on treating Peyronie's disease or post-prostatectomy shortening) suggest traction *may* stimulate:\n    <ul>\n      <li>Activation of fibroblast cells producing collagen and elastin.</li>\n      <li>Angiogenesis (formation of new blood vessels).</li>\n      <li>Increased cell proliferation in the tunica albuginea (the fibrous sheath surrounding erectile tissue).</li>\n    </ul>\n    Key studies (e.g., Levine & Latchamsetty, Warrant et al.) show modest length gains (typically 1-2 cm over 3-6 months) primarily in flaccid and stretched length, often with significant participant dropout due to discomfort or inconvenience. Evidence for substantial erectile length gain or girth increase is less robust.\n\n    ### Vacuum Pumps: Hemodynamic Effects\n    The primary mechanism is temporary vasodilation and blood engorgement. While effective for achieving an erection in ED management, claims of permanent",
