These devices operate on mechanical principles rather than pharmaceutical interventions. While traction therapy has documented clinical applications for specific conditions, its use for cosmetic enhancement remains controversial and lacks robust long-term efficacy data. This article focuses exclusively on safety protocols, risk mitigation, and evidence-based considerations when using such devices. Safety must always supersede cosmetic goals.</p>\n\n    ## Understanding Traction-Based Devices\n    <h3>How Traction Devices Work</h3>\n    <p>Traction devices apply controlled mechanical tension to penile tissue, theoretically stimulating cellular proliferation through a process called <em>tissue expansion</em>. This mechanism is clinically validated for treating Peyronie's disease (a condition involving penile curvature) under medical supervision. Devices like SizeGenetics utilize extenders worn for several hours daily to maintain tension. Research suggests traction may break down collagen fibers and promote tissue remodeling, but peer-reviewed evidence supporting significant cosmetic enlargement in healthy individuals remains limited.</p>\n\n    <h3>Scientific Evidence and Limitations</h3>\n    <p>Studies on traction therapy primarily focus on Peyronie's disease rehabilitation. A 2010 review in the Journal of Sexual Medicine reported modest length gains (1–3 cm over 3–6 months) in Peyronie's patients. However, extrapolating these results to cosmetic use lacks rigorous validation. No conclusive evidence supports permanent enhancement in anatomically typical individuals, and physiological responses vary significantly.</p>\n\n    ## Comprehensive Safety Guidelines\n    <p>Adherence to these protocols minimizes injury risk. Never prioritize device instructions over physiological warning signs.</p>\n\n    <h3>Pre-Use Medical Consultation</h3>\n    <p><strong>Mandatory Step:</strong> Consult a urologist before using any traction device. Disclose full medical history, especially regarding:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Blood clotting disorders or anticoagulant use</li>\n      <li>Penile implants, piercings, or past surgeries</li>\n      <li>Diabetes, neuropathy, or circulatory conditions</li>\n      <li>Skin sensitivity or connective tissue disorders</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Devices like SizeGenetics are contraindicated with certain health conditions.</p>\n\n    <h3>Progressive Tension and Time Management</h3>\n    <p>Aggressive tension causes tissue damage. Follow structured progression:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li><strong>Weeks 1–2:</strong> Use lowest tension setting (typically 600–900g) ≤ 2 hours/day</li>\n      <li><strong>Weeks 3–6:</strong> Gradually increase to 4–6 hours/day if no adverse effects occur</li>\n      <li><strong>Maximum:</strong> Never exceed 8 hours/day or device-specific tension limits</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Use timer alerts to prevent overuse. Daily consistency matters more than marathon sessions.</p>\n\n    <h3>Physiological Monitoring and Red Flags</h3>\n    <p>Discontinue use immediately and seek medical help if experiencing:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Persistent numbness, tingling, or coldness (nerve compression sign)</li>\n      <li>Discoloration (purple/blue hue indicating vascular compromise)</li>\n      <li>Pain beyond mild discomfort</li>\n      <li>Blisters, skin tears, or bruising</li>\n      <li>Erectile dysfunction post-use</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Conduct capillary refill tests: Press glans until pale; color should return within 2 seconds upon release.</p>\n\n    <h3>Hygiene and Device Maintenance</h3>\n    <p>Prevent infections:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Clean device components daily with medical-grade alcohol wipes</li>\n      <li>Inspect straps/attachments for wear; replace if frayed</li>\n      <li>Never share devices between users</li>\n      <li>Keep application area dry and clean</li>\n    </ul>\n\n    ## Potential Risks and Adverse Effects\n    <p>Common complications include:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li><strong>Temporary Numbness:</strong> From prolonged nerve pressure (usually resolves in hours)</li>\n      <li><strong>Skin Irritation:</strong> Blisters, abrasions, or edema around attachment points</li>\n      <li><strong>",
