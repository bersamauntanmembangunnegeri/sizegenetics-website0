Unlike surgical methods, these devices aim to stimulate gradual tissue adaptation through consistent, low-traction force. This article examines the scientific framework behind traction therapy, emphasizes the indispensable role of patience in achieving results, highlights safety considerations, and underscores the importance of evidence-based expectations and professional medical guidance.\n\n    ## Understanding Traction-Based Enhancement Devices\n\n   ",
