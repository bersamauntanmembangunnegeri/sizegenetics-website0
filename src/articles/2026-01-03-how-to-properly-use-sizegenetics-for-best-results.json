It operates on principles of **tissue expansion through mechanical traction**, a scientifically documented approach used in reconstructive medicine. When consistent tension is applied over time, traction devices stimulate cellular proliferation through a process called **tissue distraction**, potentially leading to increased length and girth. \n\n    ### Scientific Principles Behind Traction Therapy\n    Peer-reviewed studies (e.g., in *The Journal of Sexual Medicine*) indicate traction devices may:\n    - Stimulate **mitosis** (cell division) in penile tissues\n    - Promote angiogenesis (new blood vessel formation)\n    - Generate micro-tears in the tunica albuginea that remodel during healing\n    These physiological responses are similar to principles used in limb lengthening orthopedics. Research suggests traction may be most effective for:\n    - Peyronie's disease curvature correction\n    - Post-prostatectomy rehabilitation\n    - Congenital shortening concerns\n    \n    ## Critical Safety Precautions\n    ### Contraindications: When Not to Use\n    Traction devices may cause harm if used when contraindicated. Avoid usage if you have:\n    - Active genital infections (e.g., balanitis, UTIs)\n    - Unhealed surgical wounds or penile implants\n    - Bleeding disorders or anticoagulant therapy\n    - Severe erectile dysfunction unresponsive to medication\n    - Neuropathic conditions affecting genital sensation\n\n    ### Mandatory Safety Protocols\n    1. **Medical Clearance**: Consult a urologist before initiating use\n    2. **Sensation Checks**: Verify normal sensation before/after sessions\n    3. **Pain Threshold**: Discontinue immediately if experiencing sharp pain (mild discomfort may occur initially)\n    4. **Time Limitations**: Never exceed 8 hours/day continuous wear\n    5. **Skin Integrity**: Inspect for blisters, discoloration, or edema after each session\n\n    ## Optimizing Usage Protocol\n    ### Progressive Adaptation Phase (Weeks 1-4)\n    | Day | Session Duration | Tension Level | Notes |\n    |-----|------------------|--------------|-------|\n    | 1-3 | 1-2 hours | Minimal (300g) | Test fit and comfort |\n    | 4-7 | 2-4 hours | Low (400-600g) | Increase only if no adverse effects |\n    | 8-14 | 4-6 hours | Medium (600-800g) | Monitor glans temperature |\n    | 15-30 | 6-8 hours | Therapeutic (800-1200g) | Maximum recommended tension |\n\n    ### Maintenance Phase (Beyond Month 1)\n    - **Daily Duration**: 6-8 hours (split into sessions with rest breaks)\n    - **Consistency Requirement**: Minimum 5 days/week for 6+ months\n    - **Skin Protection**: Apply medical-grade silicone sleeves to prevent slippage without compromising circulation\n    - **Hygiene Protocol**: Clean device components daily with 70% isopropyl alcohol\n\n    ## Setting Realistic Expectations\n    ### Documented Clinical Outcomes\n    Based on urological studies of traction therapy:\n    - Average length gains: **1-3 cm over 6 months** (varies by individual)\n    - Results typically plateau after 9-12 months\n    - Girth changes are less documented than length\n    - 30-40% of users discontinue due to discomfort or non-compliance\n\n    ### Crucial Considerations\n    - Genetic factors significantly influence potential gains\n    - Results are irreversible only if maintained for >6 months post-achievement\n    - Combined therapies (like PDE5 inhibitors) show no proven synergistic effects\n    - Non-responder rates approach 25% in clinical trials\n\n    ## Medical Supervision Protocol\n    ### Essential Professional Consultations\n    1. **Baseline Assessment**: Urological exam including stretched flaccid measurement\n    2. **Progress Monitoring**: Bi-monthly checkups during first 6 months\n    3. **Complication Management**: Immediate consultation for:\n        - Persistent numbness >2 hours post-use\n        - Petechiae or bruising\n        - Reduced erectile rigidity\n    4. **Objective Documentation**: Measure results clinically, not subjectively\n\n    ## Conclusion: A Medical Approach\n    SizeGenetics requires disciplined adherence to medical protocols. As with all traction devices, outcomes depend on consistent application within biological limits. The therapeutic window is narrow—insufficient tension yields no results while excessive force causes tissue damage. \n\n    ### Final Recommendations\n    - **Prioritize Safety**: Dedicate 4 weeks to gradual adaptation\n    - **Document Progress**: Take monthly photos under identical conditions\n    - **Psychological Considerations**: Address unrealistic expectations that may indicate body dysmorphic disorder\n    - **Discontinuation Protocol**: Taper use over 2 weeks to prevent rebound shortening\n\n    <div class=\"disclaimer\">\n      <p><strong>Medical Disclaimer:</strong> This information does not constitute medical advice.
