Operating on the principle of <strong>mechanical tension</strong>, these devices apply consistent, low-level force to the penis, stimulating cellular growth via a process called <strong>tissue remodeling</strong>. This mechanism, supported by limited clinical studies including a 2009 <em>BJU International</em> review, suggests potential for modest length gains when used consistently and correctly. However, efficacy varies significantly between individuals, and improper use carries risks. This article focuses on scientifically grounded care protocols to maximize safety and device functionality.</p>\n\n    <h2>Why Proper Care and Maintenance Matters</h2>\n    <p>Neglecting maintenance compromises both safety and effectiveness. Poorly maintained devices may malfunction, causing:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li><strong>Injury Risk:</strong> Worn components (straps, rods) can slip or break, leading to sudden tension loss or tissue trauma.</li>\n      <li><strong>Infection:</strong> Bacterial buildup on unclean surfaces contacting the skin may cause irritation or urinary tract infections.</li>\n      <li><strong>Reduced Efficacy:</strong> Misaligned rods or degraded silicone sleeves reduce consistent force application, hindering potential results.</li>\n      <li><strong>Device Failure:</strong> Corrosion or material fatigue shortens the",
